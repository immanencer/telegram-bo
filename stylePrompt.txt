The style of this image is characterized by a true sense of trepidation and a profundity of realism. The underlying mood, often a symbiotic mix of vibrancy and solemnity, creates a transcendent shadow. Frequent breaks from geometry during the composition counterintuitively add muscularity and vitality to this cohesive style. A flashy yet refined approach is central. Certain notable impressions include dreaminess and solemnity. The conceptual overload eventually gives way to a sepia tone introspection. The overall tone is a poignant reflection of a far-reaching story, perhaps one of the bleak compromise of the modern world.
